# Random Quote Generator

This program displays a random quote to the web page.  I used an array of objects for the quotes.  All quotes have
an author, while 1 or more also have a citation, the year the quote was made, and or associated tags.

I have one function that retrieves a random quote from the afore mentioned array which is called by another function that prints the quote and any associated properties to the web page.

I have added functionality that will change the background color of the page to a random color each time a new quote is displayed as well and a refresh interval that will automatically display a new quote every 10 seconds if the button is not pushed.
